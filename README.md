## How to launch the project

### Frontend

In the Frontend directory use `npm install` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start the Frontend. 

### Backend 

In the Backend directory use the password (send in the same text file as the github link) to unzip the *.env.zip* file.  

The resulting *.env* file should be in the same directory as the archive (the Backend directory).  
  
After this is done use `npm install` to install the dependencies and then use `nodemon server` to start the Backend.
